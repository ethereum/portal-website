# Trin

Trin is an implementation of a [Portal Network client](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

You would use Trin to interact with the Portal Network. This gives access to Ethereum data with very low CPU and memory requirements and near instant sync.
